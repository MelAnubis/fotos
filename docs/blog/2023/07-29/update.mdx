Hello, Immich fans, another month, another milestone. We hope you are staying cool and safe in this scorching hot summer across the globe.

Immich had made some good recognition when getting to the front page of HackerNews, which helped to let more people know about the project's existence. The project will help more and more people seek a solution to control the privacy of their most precious moments. And with the gain in popularity and recognition, we have gotten new users and more questions from the community than ever. I want to express my gratitude to all the contributors and the community who have been tremendously helpful to new users' questions and provided technical support.

Below are the highlights of new features we added to the application over the past month, along with countless bug fixes and improvements across the board, from developer experience to resource optimization and UI/UX improvement. I hope you find these topics as exciting as I am.

## Highlights

- Memories feature in the mobile app.
- Facial recognition improvements.
- Improvements on multi selection behavior on the web.
- Shortcuts for common actions on the web.
- Support for 360-panorama photos.
