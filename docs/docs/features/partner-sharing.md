# Partner Sharing

Immich allows you to share your library with other users. They can then view your library and download the assets.
You can manage one or multiple users to have access to your library from the [User Settings](docs/features/user-settings.md) page.

Partner sharing include:

- All your photos and videos except those in Archived and Deleted.
- You are at the mercy of the partners' actions (as it should be) on the asset they own. If the partner decides to delete or archive an asset belonging to them, it will not be displayed on your timeline.
- The location where your photos were taken.
- You can view partners' media and add them to an album. No other actions are allowed on those assets.
- Facial data is not shared (yet)
- The search result doesn't include partners' assets (yet)
- You cannot favorite partners' assets (yet)

:::info
Partner sharing is one-sided, whoever shared with you will not be able to see your photos  
unless you share them with them through partner sharing from your user.

## Add Partner

- Partner sharing may result in displaying duplicate assets on the main timeline. We would like to address this soon.

<img src={require('./img/partner-sharing-1.png').default} width="70%" title='Partner Sharing 1' />

<img src={require('./img/partner-sharing-2.png').default} width="70%" title='Partner Sharing 2' />

<img src={require('./img/partner-sharing-4.png').default} width="70%" title='Partner Sharing 4' />

## Accessing to the Shared Library

Accessing the shared library can be done from the Sharing page.

<img src={require('./img/partner-sharing-3.png').default} width="70%" title='Partner Sharing 3' />

:::tip Sharing specific assets
For sharing a specific set of assets, you can use the shared album feature of Immich.

## Partner sharing on the main timeline

to enable parter-shared photos to be displayed in the main timeline. This feature can be enabled on a per-partner basis and can be viewed and updated on both the web and mobile app.

### For the web interface:

Account’s Setting -> Sharing -> Show in timeline

<img src={require('./img/partner-sharing-5.png').default} width="70%" title='Partner Sharing 5' />

### For the mobile app:

From the partner’s view, on the top right corner of the app bar

<img src={require('./img/partner-sharing-6.png').default} width="30%" title='Partner Sharing 6' />
