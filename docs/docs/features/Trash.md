# Trash

Trash feature, which is similar to the trash section on your native photo viewer. When a photo is deleted from Immich, it will go into the trash and stay there for 30 days before being permanently removed from Immich, which includes the database and the file system for non-external library assets. You can access the page from the sidebar on the web and the app drawer menu in the mobile app. Like with most features in Immich, you can adjust the trash duration or even opt out of the feature entirely from the Administration Settings.

Actions
Additional actions you can do with trash feature are:

- Multiple selection of files to delete permanently or restore.
- Empty Trash - This will remove all the assets in trash permanently from Immich. You cannot undo this action!
- Restore All.

:::tip Keyboard shortcut for permanently deletion
You can select assets and press Ctrl + Del from the timeline for quick permanent deletion without the trash option.
