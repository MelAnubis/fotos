# Support the project

I've committed to this project, and I will not stop. I will keep updating the docs, adding new features, and fixing bugs. But I can't do it alone. So I need your help to give me additional motivation to keep going.

As our hosts in the [selfhosted.show - In the episode 'The-organization-must-not-be-name is a Hostile Actor'](https://selfhosted.show/79?t=1418) said, this is a massive undertaking that the team and I are doing. And I would love to someday be able to do this full-time, and I am asking for your help to make that happen.

If you feel like this is the right cause and the app is something you are seeing yourself using for a long time, please consider donating to the project.
