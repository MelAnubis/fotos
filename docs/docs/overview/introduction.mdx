Hello, my name is Alex. I am an Electrical Engineer by schooling, then turned into a Software Engineer by trade.

We were lying in bed with our newborn, and my wife said, "I don't want to pay for **_App-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named_** anymore, and you always want to build something for me. So why don't you build me an app which can do that?"

That was how the idea started to grow in my head. I began to find existing solutions in the self-hosting space with similar backup functionality and the performance level of the **_App-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named_**. Still, I wanted more from the results.

Another motivation that pushed me to deliver my execution of the **_App-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named_** alternative or replacement is for contributing back to the open source community that I have greatly benefited from over the years.

I'm proud to share this creation with you, who values privacy, memories, and the joy of looking back at those moments in an easy-to-use and friendly interface.
