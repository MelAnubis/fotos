Hello, my name is Alex and I am an Electrical Engineer by school, then turned into a Software Engineer by trade.

We were laying in bed with our new born and my wife said "I don't want to pay for **_App-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named_** anymore, and you always want to build something for me, why don't build me an app which can do that?"

That was how the idea starting to grow in my head. I started to find existing solutions in the self-hosting space that has similar backup functionality, and the performance level of the **_App-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named_** but I was not satisfy with the existing results.

Another motivation that pushed me to deliver my execution of the **_App-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named_** alternative or replacement is for contributing back to the open source community that I have greatly benefited from over the years.

I'm proud to share this creation with you, whom values privacy, memories and the joy in looking back at those moments in an easy to use and friendly interface.
