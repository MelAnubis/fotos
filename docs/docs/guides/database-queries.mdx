# Helpful database queries for advanced debugging of Immich

## Prerequisites

In order to execute the queries, you must first connect to the container and get the postgres shell.

### Docker Compose

If you are using docker compose, simply run `docker exec -it immich_postgres psql immich DB_USERNAME` while `DB_USERNAME`
should be replaced by the according value [set in your `.env` file](https://docs.immich.app/docs/install/environment-variables#database).

### GUI (Portainer, Unraid, ...)

When using a GUI, it will most likely provide the ability to create a shell within the container.
In that shell, simply run `psql immich DB_USERNAME` while replacing your `DB_USERNAME` like explained above.

### Kubernetes

If you're using Kubernetes in your home lab you are crazy and know how to run a command anyway.

## Queries

:::caution
Don't forget the ';' at the end of each query ;)
:::

<Tabs queryString='query'>
<TabItem value="assetInformatonByName" label="Get asset information by file name" default>

```sql
SELECT
	"id" AS "Id", "originalFileName" AS "File name", "originalPath" AS "Path"
FROM
	"assets"
WHERE
	"originalFileName" = 'FILE NAME';
```

`FILE NAME` should hereby be replaced by the according file name.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="assetsWithoutMetadata" label="Get all assets without metadata">

```sql
SELECT
  "assetId" AS "Id", "originalFileName" AS "File name", "livePhotoCID" AS "Live photo id"
FROM
  "exif"
LEFT JOIN
  "assets" ON "assets"."id" = "exif"."assetId"
WHERE
	"exif"."assetId" IS NULL;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="systemConfig" label="Get stored system config">
