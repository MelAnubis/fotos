# Database Info

To better understand how Immich works behind the scenes, you can see a short explanation of the tables in the database, in order not to make the page too complicated we tried to make it as simple as possible.

For further expansion in the database, you can follow a [guide](/docs/guides/database-gui.md) for viewing the database through PgAdmin.
