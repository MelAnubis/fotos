## Step 1 - Download the mobile app

The mobile app can be downloaded from

- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.alextran.immich)
- [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/immich/id1613945652)

## Step 2 - Registering the admin user

The first user to register will be the admin user. The admin user will have the ability to add other users to the application.

To register for the admin user, access the web application at `http://<machine-ip-address>:2283` and click on the **Getting Started** button.

Follow the prompt to register for the admin user and log in to the application.

## Step 3 - Creating a new user (optional)

If you have a family member that want to use the application, you can create a new account for them. The default password is `password` and the user can change their password after logging in the application for the first time.
