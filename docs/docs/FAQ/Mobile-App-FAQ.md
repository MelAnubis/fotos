### What is the difference between the cloud icon on the mobile app?

| Icon                               | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![cloud](/img/cloud.svg)           | Asset is only available in the cloud and was uploaded from some other device (like the web client) or was deleted from this device after upload |
| ![cloud-cross](/img/cloud-off.svg) | Asset is only available locally and has not yet been backed up                                                                                  |
| ![cloud-done](/img/cloud-done.svg) | Asset was uploaded from this device and is now backed up in the cloud/server and still available in original on the device                      |
