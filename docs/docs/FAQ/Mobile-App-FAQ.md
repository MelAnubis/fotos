# Mobile App

### What is the difference between the cloud icons on the mobile app?

| Icon                               | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![cloud](/img/cloud.svg)           | Asset is only available in the cloud and was uploaded from some other device (like the web client) or was deleted from this device after upload |
| ![cloud-cross](/img/cloud-off.svg) | Asset is only available locally and has not yet been backed up                                                                                  |
| ![cloud-done](/img/cloud-done.svg) | Asset was uploaded from this device and is now backed up to the server; the original file is still on the device                      |


### IOS app

 ### I can't log into the application after the server update, what can I do?
 Make sure you've updated the app as well.

:::note
app store updates sometimes take longer because the stores (play store; Google and app store; Apple)
need to approve the update first which may take some time.
