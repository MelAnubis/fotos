Yes you can by using Immich CLI with -a command, see [this document](http://localhost:3005/docs/features/command-line-interface) for more info.

### there is a way to select the order in which photos are presented when an album is opened?
Not yet, but it's [something planned](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/1689)
