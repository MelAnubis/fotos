# Albums

### Can I import assets to Immich while maintaining existing album structure?

Yes. You can by use [Immich CLI](/docs/features/command-line-interface) along with the `--album` flag.

### Is there a way to select the order in which photos are presented when an album is opened?

No, not yet. For updates on this planned feature, follow the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/1689),
