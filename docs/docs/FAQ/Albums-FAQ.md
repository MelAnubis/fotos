# Albums

### Can I import assets to Immich while maintaining existing album structure?

Yes you can by using Immich CLI with -a command, see [this document](/docs/features/command-line-interface) for more info.

### Is there a way to select the order in which photos are presented when an album is opened?
Not yet, but this is a [planned feature](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/1689).
