### Is all data local?
Everything stays local, the models get downloaded from a repository the first time you run it.
Machine learning is also done locally,
Machine learning URL isn't pointing to the external page. It is the DNS of the container within the docker's network context.
Model retrievals are done automatically from the [hugging face repository](https://huggingface.co/immich-app). more info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/immich/comments/17obeyj/is_all_data_local/).
